Exhaust dB Checker - the easiest way to measure your exhaust noise

Want to know if your exhaust violates Indonesian noise regulations? We use your phone's built-in mic to measure exhaust noise

NOTE: mic in some devices can only recognize less than ~90 dB, and in some cases automatic gain control and mic quality may interfere with operation
